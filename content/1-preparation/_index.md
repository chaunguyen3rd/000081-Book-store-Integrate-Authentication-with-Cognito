    - Open **FCJ-Serverless-Workshop** with VSCode and edit.
      - Open **src/component/Authen/Login.js** and edit as below.
        ```
        data: JSON.stringify({
            username: email,
            password: password
        })
        ```

        data: JSON.stringify({
          username: email,
          password: password

        data: JSON.stringify({
            username: email,
            confirmation_code: code
        })
        ```
        ![Preparation](/000081-Book-store-Integrate-Authentication-with-Cognito/images/temp/1/3.png?width=90pc)
    - Back to **FCJ-Serverless-Workshop** root path and run the commands below.
      ```
      yarn
      yarn build
      ```

5. We have finished building the front-end. Next execute the following command to upload the **build** folder to S3.
    ```
    aws s3 cp build s3://fcj-book-shop-by-myself --recursive
    ```

So we have rebuilt the web application.
